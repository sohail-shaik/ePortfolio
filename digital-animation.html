            <h3></h3>
            <p>The animation project "The Science Behind Meteor Glow," reflects the integration of creativity and education. This project highlights the power of multimedia tools like animation to simplify and visually communicate complex scientific concepts, making them engaging and accessible. By depicting the meteor’s fiery glow and its scientific explanation through motion, color, and minimal text, the animation provides a compelling educational experience in under 15 seconds.

                Creating this project involved designing the meteor with gradient fills and a dynamic glow effect, applying motion tweening for its curved descent, and layering stars and planets for depth. Fade-in/out transitions for text added clarity and focus to the scientific explanation.
                
                However, the process was not without challenges. Mastering Adobe Animate, particularly motion tweening for smooth movements, required experimentation. Achieving a realistic glow effect involved careful adjustments to the Glow Filter’s settings. Managing multiple layers—meteor, stars, planets, and text—was time-intensive, demanding precise alignment and timing. Additionally, condensing the animation into less than 15 seconds while ensuring clarity and engagement required multiple iterations and refinements.
                
                This project, showcased in my ePortfolio, demonstrates my ability to blend technical and instructional design skills, emphasizing the value of multimedia in education. </p>
