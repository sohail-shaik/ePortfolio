            <h1>Sohail's ePortfolio</h1>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer and Information Science at the University of Florida, expected to graduate in May 2025. My academic journey began in India, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation. After graduation, I worked as a Data Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services for two years, gaining valuable industry experience with the American Automobile Association (AAA) client. During this time, I developed strong skills in data processing, cloud computing, and automation, significantly improving data quality and efficiency. My technical expertise spans various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, including Python, SQL, Java, Django, TensorFlow, Google Cloud Platform, and Salesforce. I've worked on several projects that showcase my abilities, such as developing CNN models for maize grain quality classification and creating an AI-driven sentiment analysis tool for movie reviews. As part of my Master's coursework, I'm currently enrolled in EME 6208 Emerging Learning Technology, where I'm expanding my skills in image editing, web design, video production, screencasting, and digital animation. This course is helping me create a personal e-portfolio that reflects my journey, blending my technical expertise with creativity. I'm excited to continue growing in the tech world while pursuing my passions for problem-solving, innovation, travel, and sports.</p>
