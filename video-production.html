            <h3>Video Description</h3>
            <p>For my *Victoria Falls* video project, I aimed to capture the breathtaking beauty and ecological significance of this natural wonder. Known as *Mosi-oa-Tunya*, or "The Smoke That Thunders," Victoria Falls is a spectacular waterfall located on the Zambezi River, attracting visitors with its wildlife, adventure activities, and serene environment. The video highlights not only the grandeur of the falls but also the surrounding ecosystem and various activities, such as bungee jumping.</p>
            <p>Using iMovie, I employed various editing techniques to bring the video to life. I utilized the Ken Burns effect on still images to add dynamic motion, making the visuals more engaging. I also integrated smooth transitions like dissolve and crossfade to maintain flow between scenes. Captions provided essential context, and background music complemented the majestic tone of the video without overpowering the narration. One of the key challenges I faced was balancing the educational content with visual appeal in a way that was engaging yet informative. Despite the challenges, I learned how to seamlessly blend technical editing skills with storytelling, creating a polished and immersive experience for the viewer.</p>

            <h3>Editing Process in iMovie</h3>
            <ul class="editing-process-list">
                <li><strong>Transitions:</strong> I used dissolve and crossfade transitions to ensure smooth and natural scene changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Ken Burns Effect:</strong> Applied to still images to create dynamic movement and enhance visual engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Captions:</strong> Added concise captions for context, such as "Surrounding Rainforest" and "Adventures" for the bungee jumping scenes.</li>
                <li><strong>Background Music & Narration:</strong> Chose ambient music to complement the video's tone and synced narration with visuals for a cohesive feel.</li>
                <li><strong>Title & Credits:</strong> Included a formal title screen and credits to acknowledge resources used in the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project allowed me to refine my video editing skills in iMovie and improve my ability to tell a compelling, informative story through multimedia.</p>
