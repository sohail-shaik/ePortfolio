            <h2>Screencast Tutorial: How to Use Google Colab</h2>
            <p>In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to get started with Google Colab, a powerful cloud-based platform for running Python code. The screencast focuses on teaching you how to load and display an image using Python, along with exploring key features of Google Colab that make coding in the cloud efficient and user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>Topics Covered</h3>
            <ul class="key-features">
                <li>Creating a Notebook: Setting up a new notebook and renaming it for better organization.</li>
                <li>Adding and Managing Cells: Using text cells for documentation and code cells for running Python scripts.</li>
                <li>Accessing Files: Uploading an image file directly to the runtime and explaining how to mount Google Drive for file access.</li>
                <li>Changing Runtime Settings: Managing runtime types and optimizing resource usage.</li>
                <li>Exporting Notebooks: Saving your work in .ipynb or .py formats and downloading for offline use as PDF format.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technologies and Tools Used</h3>
            <ul class="key-features">
                <li>Google Colab: To demonstrate Python code execution in a cloud-based environment.</li>
                <li>Camtasia: For recording and editing the screencast, applying effects like zoom, pan, and callouts to ensure clarity.</li>
                <li>Annotations and Callouts: Highlight key steps and guide viewers through the tutorial effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Preview</h3>

            <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This screencast allowed me to not only enhance my technical skills in using Google Colab for cloud-based Python development, but also refine my ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and engaging way. Recording and editing the screencast with Camtasia helped me develop a deeper understanding of the tool’s capabilities, from capturing the screen to adding annotations that guide viewers through the tutorial effectively.</p>
            
            <p>Creating this tutorial has significantly improved my communication skills, particularly in teaching technical subjects. It also reinforced the importance of clear, concise instructions and visual aids in making educational content more accessible. Through this experience, I learned how to break down a technical process into digestible steps, and I’m confident that this skill will be invaluable in future projects, both for creating tutorials and for explaining complex data-related concepts to non-technical audiences.</p>
