            <h2>Game of Thrones Pop Quiz</h2>
            <p>I chose "Game of Thrones" for this quiz project due to its popularity and ability to engage fans. The quiz is designed to test users' knowledge of characters, events, and key moments from the series. The layout features a dark background with a blurred image overlay and a medieval, fantasy-inspired font to evoke the show's atmosphere. Styled elements such as buttons, inputs, and text areas, along with smooth navigation, provide an interactive and immersive experience.</p>
            <p>Technically, the quiz utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a seamless experience. The background creates a cinematic effect, and the controls are optimized for easy navigation. JavaScript handles question generation, cheat mode, and the display of correct/incorrect answers, all while matching the overall theme. The result is a fun, engaging quiz that showcases my web design and programming skills.</p>

            <h2>Directors and Their Movies Drag-and-Drop Quiz</h2>
            <p>I transformed the original learning theory-based drag-and-drop quiz into a "Directors and Movies" quiz. Users now match famous directors like "Christopher Nolan" and "Quentin Tarantino" to iconic movies such as "Inception" and "Pulp Fiction". This theme change brings the quiz into the world of cinema, offering a fun, interactive experience for movie fans.</p>
            <p>On the technical side, I retained the core drag-and-drop functionality and enhanced the design with a dark, cinematic color scheme and modern layout. The director boxes are now aligned in a grid layout with box shadows, and the drag items have bright hover effects. Users also receive immediate visual feedback on correct or incorrect answers, with dynamic borders adding interactivity to the experience. The result is a more engaging and visually appealing quiz for movie enthusiasts.</p>
