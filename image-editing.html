            <h2 class="project-title">Book Cover: "Whisper in the Dark"</h2>
            <p class="project-text">For this project, I created a book cover for "Whisper in the Dark" by Joseph Bruchac, a captivating mystery about Maddy, a young girl with Native American roots, who confronts supernatural forces linked to an ancient family legend. The cover needed to visually capture the eerie and suspenseful tone of the story, which combines elements of fear, mystery, and Native American culture. I focused on illustrating the sinister force that haunts the protagonist, Maddy, through the use of symbolic imagery and bold design choices.</p>
            <p class="project-text">The design features a shadowy, elongated figure floating on the left side, symbolizing the supernatural entity, the Whispering Dark. The ghostly figure’s exaggerated, claw-like hands enhance the horror aspects of the story, representing the looming, menacing presence that stalks Maddy. To further evoke the theme of danger, I incorporated a ghostly, screaming face emerging from the fog in the lower-right corner. This face represents the voices of the past, reflecting the Abenaki legends central to the plot, and underscores the hidden dangers threatening Maddy. The combination of these elements, along with an eerie forest backdrop, visually conveys the novel's supernatural and cultural essence, reinforcing its themes of mystery and fear while maintaining a strong connection to Maddy's heritage. Through this design, I aimed to create a cover that encapsulates both the suspense of the storyline and the deep-rooted cultural narrative that drives it.</p>

            <h2 class="project-title">Logo: "Limitless Frames: Crafting Unique Narratives"</h2>
            <!-- Logo Explanation -->
            <p class="project-text">The logo for "Limitless Frames: Crafting Unique Narratives" was designed to encapsulate the essence of a film production company that champions bold, unconventional scripts. A minimalist approach was taken to create a clean, geometric design that merges the worlds of cinema and creativity. The central element of the logo is a clapperboard, made from a simple rectangle with two horizontal lines representing the film strip. This symbol emphasizes the cinematic process, while also conveying the company's focus on the craft of filmmaking.</p>
            <p class="project-text">To complement the clapperboard, a sleek, modern quill is integrated into the design. The quill, which extends slightly above the clapperboard, symbolizes the writer’s integral role in filmmaking. It serves to highlight the connection between the written word and the art of cinema, reinforcing the idea that storytelling is at the heart of the filmmaking process. The elements are centrally aligned, maintaining a balanced structure that speaks to professionalism and clarity. The minimalist blue color palette was chosen to convey boldness and innovation, reflecting the company's dedication to supporting unique, thought-provoking scripts that break away from mainstream trends.</p>
            <p class="project-text">This logo visually represents the company's mission of fostering creative storytelling and supporting filmmakers who challenge traditional cinematic conventions. The fusion of the clapperboard and quill speaks to the blending of traditional filmmaking with new, bold ideas, while the clean design reflects a commitment to simplicity and quality.</p>
